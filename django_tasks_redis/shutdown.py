"""
Graceful shutdown support for task runners.

When a worker process receives a termination signal (typically ``SIGTERM``
sent by a container orchestrator during a deployment), it should stop
picking up new tasks but let the task it is currently running finish,
instead of being killed in the middle of the work.

Example usage:
    from django_tasks_redis import GracefulShutdown, is_shutdown_requested

    with GracefulShutdown() as shutdown:
        while not shutdown.is_set():
            messages = broker.receive(wait_seconds=5, worker_id=worker_id)
            if not messages:
                continue
            run(messages[0])

Long running task functions can cooperate with the shutdown by checking
``is_shutdown_requested()`` and returning early:

    from django_tasks_redis import is_shutdown_requested

    @task
    def process_rows(row_ids):
        for row_id in row_ids:
            if is_shutdown_requested():
                break
            handle(row_id)

This module is the one django-database-task ships as
``django_database_task.shutdown``, so a worker loop written against one
package reads the same against the other.

    Args:

        timeout: Maximum number of seconds to keep running after a shutdown
            request before forcing the process to exit. ``0`` (default)
            waits indefinitely for the current task to finish.
        on_signal: Optional callable invoked as ``on_signal(signum, count)``
            from the signal handler, where ``count`` is the number of
            shutdown requests received so far. Useful for reporting to the
            console.
        force_on_repeat: If True (default), a second signal exits the
            process immediately instead of waiting for the current task.
        log_signals: If True (default), received signals are logged. Set to
            False when ``on_signal`` already reports them, to avoid printing
            the same information twice.
